Superstore Sales & Profit Analysis Dashboard – Internship Project (Power BI )

Excited to share my latest Power BI project built as part of my ongoing internship at Future Intern! 🚀

This 3-page interactive dashboard is based on the popular Superstore dataset and designed to help stakeholders uncover actionable insights to improve sales performance, profitability, and operational efficiency.

📊 Key Highlights:

Used Power Query Editor to clean data, extract time-based features, and enrich the dataset without Python.

Built an optimized data model using a fact table (Orders) and lookup tables (Returns, People), following dimensional modeling best practices.

Designed 3 dashboard pages:
1️⃣ Executive Overview – KPIs, regional insights, category sales
2️⃣ Profit & Sales Analysis – Decomposition Tree, product-level profit trends, discount impact
3️⃣ Detailed Drilldown – Return rate, quantity sold, profit margins by product/customer

Implemented advanced DAX functions, smart narratives, and conditional formatting to surface key business patterns and underperformance signals.

🎯 Tools Used:
Power BI | Power Query | DAX | Advanced Visuals 

📁 Objective: Help Superstore improve decision-making by identifying top-selling products, loss-making segments, and return-heavy regions—all from a single interactive report.
